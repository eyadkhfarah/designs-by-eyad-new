              I always thought my dream was to be a artist for a little indie
              publishing company, chill out in to the club and take a table and
              draw. I gravitated toward proofreading and quality control
              positions and even started my own artwork business. But I kind of
              just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something
              different.

              I started Photoshop since I want to make a social media design for
              my business profile and I learned the fundamental of design and I
              was so enthusiastic about it, it was my lovely moment when I
              export my first Photoshop design and I was so good not wow because
              this is my first design and the I had improve my design skills
              until I learned a lot like logo design, vector art, manipulating
              photos and drawing in Photoshop.
